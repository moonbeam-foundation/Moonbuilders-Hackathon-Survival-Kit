## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is is the smart contract platform for cross-chain connected applications, which offer superior user experiences by unifying access to users, assets, and services across any existing blockchain. Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-Compatible Layer-1 blockchain (also known as a *Parachain*) on Polkadot.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot is a Layer 0 protocol designed to enable interoperability amongst the hetereogenous L1 blockchains that run on top of it. Polkadot provides the security, governance, and cross chain communication to enable seamless interoperability between parachains, or L1 blockchains that serve various specialized use cases. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain. 

## Meet the Networks (and block explorers)
* **<a href="https://moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbeam</a>** - Mainnet, operating as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonriver.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonriver</a>** - Canary network, or experimental mainnet. Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonbase.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbase Alpha</a>** - The public testnet for Moonbeam and Moonriver. 

## Moonbase Alpha Faucet
* You can get [DEV testnet tokens here](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/faucet/).
