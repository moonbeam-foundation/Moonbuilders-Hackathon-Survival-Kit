## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is is the smart contract platform for cross-chain connected applications, which offer superior user experiences by unifying access to users, assets, and services across any existing blockchain. Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-Compatible Layer-1 blockchain (also known as a *Parachain*) on Polkadot.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot is a Layer 0 protocol designed to enable interoperability amongst the hetereogenous L1 blockchains that run on top of it. Polkadot provides the security, governance, and cross chain communication to enable seamless interoperability between parachains, or L1 blockchains that serve various specialized use cases. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain. 

## Meet the Networks (and block explorers)
* **<a href="https://moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbeam</a>** - Mainnet, operating as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonriver.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonriver</a>** - Canary network, or experimental mainnet. Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonbase.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbase Alpha</a>** - The public testnet for Moonbeam and Moonriver. 

## Moonbase Alpha Faucet
* You can get [DEV testnet tokens here](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/faucet/).
* You can make a swap for [testnet cross chain assets here](https://moonbeam-swap.netlify.app/#/swap).
* If you need more tokens in bulk for testing purposes don't hesitate to reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonbeam).

### Judging Criteria
Each submissions will be judged based on 3 categories:

* Technical Complexity - High scoring submissions in this category may demonstrate impressive technical skill and quality of implementation.
* User Experience and Design - Can you abstract away complex cross-chain concepts into a simple and intuitive experience for the end user?
* *For the Cross-Chain Bounty Only*: Cross-Chain Interoperability- Does your application contribute to a cross-chain connected future? The highest scoring submissions in this category will be built with interoperability in mind.
* *For the Precompile Bounty Only*: Creativity and Value Proposition - Are you making something users want? The highest scoring submissions in this category will be creative solutions that fulfill the needs of their users. Copy / paste deployments from other chains will be ranked lower in this category.
