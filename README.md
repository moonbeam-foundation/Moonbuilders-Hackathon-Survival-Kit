* **[Building Cross-Chain DApps with Axelar](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/connected-contracts/3)** - ***Wednesday, August 24th at 1pm EST***: Axelar Developer Vladimir Agaev will show you how to quickly get started with Axelar and build cross-chain dapps.
 

## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is is the smart contract platform for cross-chain connected applications, which offer superior user experiences by unifying access to users, assets, and services across any existing blockchain. Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-Compatible Layer-1 blockchain (also known as a *Parachain*) on Polkadot.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot is a Layer 0 protocol designed to enable interoperability amongst the hetereogenous L1 blockchains that run on top of it. Polkadot provides the security, governance, and cross chain communication to enable seamless interoperability between parachains, or L1 blockchains that serve various specialized use cases. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain. 

## Meet the Networks (and block explorers)
* **<a href="https://moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbeam</a>** - Mainnet, operating as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonriver.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonriver</a>** - Canary network, or experimental mainnet. Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonbase.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbase Alpha</a>** - The public testnet for Moonbeam and Moonriver. 

## Connect to the Moonbeam Networks
You can connect your wallet to the following Moonbeam networks automatically by visiting the Moonbeam docs site and pressing the **[Connect MetaMask](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)** button at the top or manually with the following instructions:
