## Talks & Workshops ✏️
* **[Buidl Week - Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM on Moonbeam/Polkadot](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/26fe998b-c291-47f0-8a7b-42e1de99ddcf/d02df489-2db2-4917-8b53-e4b3547f7f87)** - ***Saturday, February 25 at 10:20am MST @Buidl Hub Mainstage***: In this talk we'll discuss how Polkadot's interoperability protocol works at a high level. And we'll go into more details of how this can be used to access Moonbeam's EVM from a different chain. This opens a new realm of possibilities, as contracts in Moonbeam can access app-specialized blockchains inside the Polkadot ecosystem. But also, these specialized chain can tap into Moonbeam's EVM and all the benefits smart contracts offer.
* **[Buidl Week - Build your First DAO and deploy it to Moonbeam using HardHat](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/26fe998b-c291-47f0-8a7b-42e1de99ddcf/d02df489-2db2-4917-8b53-e4b3547f7f87)** - ***Sunday, February 26 at 12:00pm MST and 4:30pm MST (There are 2 identical sessions for this workshop, you can attend either)***: In this talk we'll discuss how Polkadot's interoperability protocol works at a high level. And we'll go into more details of how this can be used to access Moonbeam's EVM from a different chain. This opens a new realm of possibilities, as contracts in Moonbeam can access app-specialized blockchains inside the Polkadot ecosystem. But also, these specialized chain can tap into Moonbeam's EVM and all the benefits smart contracts offer.
* **[Cross Chain Protocol Architectures: Key Trends and
Challenges in 2023](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/8cade9b6-3b1e-4b51-83e6-91132e2f6e7a/3c2e7611-a7b2-4535-bfcc-3647561bf1c4)** - ***Thursday, March 2nd at 5pm MST @Infrastructure + Scalability Stage***: In this talk, Derek Yoo, Founder of Moonbeam, will share his experience helping dozens of projects pursuing multi-chain strategies. Derek will also dive into cross-chain protocol architectures, current market opportunities, and challenges, including market trends and future directions for cross-chain apps and infrastructure. 
* **[Remote Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/0247a52b-aaee-4bcd-b099-41006497962b/fe8cecbb-68ae-4841-a6d1-482f11c05ff0)** - ***Friday, March 3rd at 11:30am MST @Buidl Palace***: Kevin Neilson and Stephen Shelton will introduce you to XCM and Remote EVM Calls. With remote cross-chain EVM calls now live on the testnet, you can now send an XCM message from a remote chain containing a contract call to be executed on Moonbeam's EVM. We'll go through the steps of generating a derivative account on Moonbeam that we'll control remotely via XCM. Then, we'll jump into crafting our remote EVM call - we'll initiate a swap on a Uniswap-style Dex to take place all from a remote chain.
 
## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today's fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam's developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains. Apps and services on Polkadot can securely communicate across chains, forming the basis for a truly interoperable decentralized web. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain. 

## Meet the Networks (and block explorers)
* **<a href="https://moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbeam</a>** - Mainnet, operating as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonriver.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonriver</a>** - Canary network, or experimental mainnet. Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonbase.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbase Alpha</a>** - The public testnet for Moonbeam and Moonriver. 

## Connect to the Moonbeam Networks
You can connect your wallet to the following Moonbeam networks automatically by visiting the Moonbeam docs site and pressing the **[Connect MetaMask](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)** button at the top or manually with the following instructions:
