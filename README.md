## Talks & Workshops ‚úèÔ∏è
* **[Buidl Week - Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM on Moonbeam/Polkadot](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/26fe998b-c291-47f0-8a7b-42e1de99ddcf/d02df489-2db2-4917-8b53-e4b3547f7f87)** - ***Saturday, February 25 at 10:20am MST @Buidl Hub Mainstage***: In this talk we'll discuss how Polkadot's interoperability protocol works at a high level. And we'll go into more details of how this can be used to access Moonbeam's EVM from a different chain. This opens a new realm of possibilities, as contracts in Moonbeam can access app-specialized blockchains inside the Polkadot ecosystem. But also, these specialized chain can tap into Moonbeam's EVM and all the benefits smart contracts offer.

Derek will also dive into cross-chain protocol architectures, current market opportunities, and challenges, including market trends and future directions for cross-chain apps and infrastructure. 
* **[Remote Cross-Chain EVM Calls with XCM](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/0247a52b-aaee-4bcd-b099-41006497962b/fe8cecbb-68ae-4841-a6d1-482f11c05ff0)** - ***Friday, March 3rd at 11:30am MST @Buidl Palace***: Kevin Neilson and Stephen Shelton will introduce you to XCM and Remote EVM Calls. With remote cross-chain EVM calls now live on the testnet, you can now send an XCM message from a remote chain containing a contract call to be executed on Moonbeam's EVM. We'll go through the steps of generating a derivative account on Moonbeam that we'll control remotely via XCM. Then, we'll jump into crafting our remote EVM call - we'll initiate a swap on a Uniswap-style Dex to take place all from a remote chain.
 
## üé• Introducing Moonbeam's 2023 EthDenver Bounties
In the below video, Kevin reveals Moonbeam's 2023 Bounties including the challenge descriptions, expectations, and prizes.

[![Introductory Video](https://i.ibb.co/h8bBfGq/You-Tube-Thumbnails-43.png)](https://youtu.be/pufGqu1h8YU)

## Bounty 1 - Make a Remote Contract Call

General Message Passing (GMP) Protocols allow you to send messages to other chains, including messages that contain contract call data and can trigger actions on remote chains such as buying an NFT, making a swap, & much more.

Moonbeam has integrated with a variety of GMP Protocols including Axelar, Hyperlane, LayerZero, Wormhole & of course, Polkadot's native XCM. These protocols make it truly easy to call a contract on a remote chain - all you need to do is specify the destination chain, the contract address you want to interact with, and the payload (contract call data). It‚Äôs that simple. 

In order to be eligible for this bounty, your dApp should have at least some smart contract logic deployed to Moonbeam or Moonbase Alpha. Secondly, it needs to implement a cross-chain contract call that plays a non-trivial role in the application. As an example, if you‚Äôre building a cross-chain DEX, a cross-chain contract call that sends a message ‚ÄúHELLO WORLD‚Äù to another chain at random intervals would be considered trivial and not related to the dApp‚Äôs purpose. 

## Bounty 2 - Use the Batch or Call Permit Precompile

Moonbeam has a variety of precompiles, such as the batch precompile and call permit precompile that offer powerful functionality to builders which can vastly improve the UX for dApp users. The batch precompile allows you to combine multiple smart contract calls into a single transaction. These groupings can be atomic or nonatomic at your discretion. 

The quintessential example of a batched transaction that simplifies the UX for end users is batching together the approval and swap transactions for DEX. Rather than a user having to confirm an approval transaction and a swap transaction, the user can confirm a single batched transaction that executes both within the same block. In this case, you‚Äôd want the batch transaction to be atomic, because there‚Äôs no need to approve an ERC-20 allowance if the swap reverts. 

Another possibility is to use the Call Permit Precompile. One of the most frustrating experiences for a user new to Web3 is acquiring gas to pay for transactions. You can substantially improve your dApp‚Äôs UX by eliminating the requirement that the user hold the native token for gas. Moonbeam‚Äôs call permit precompile enables you to do exactly that - with it, you can dispatch any transaction in a gasless manner which can be relayed by Biconomy.

To be eligible for this bounty, your dApp should have at least some smart contract logic deployed to Moonbeam or Moonbase Alpha. Secondly, it must utilize the batch precompile or the call permit precompile (or both) to provide any non-trivial functionality to your dApp. 


## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications that can access users, assets, and services on any chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today's fragmented user experience ‚Äî unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam's developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot unites and secures a growing ecosystem of specialized blockchains called parachains. Apps and services on Polkadot can securely communicate across chains, forming the basis for a truly interoperable decentralized web. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain.
