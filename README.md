## What's Moonbeam?
Moonbeam is a platform for cross-chain connected applications that unites assets and functionality from many blockchains. Moonbeam is a fully Ethereum-Compatible Layer-1 blockchain (also known as a *Parachain*) on Polkadot.

## What's Polkadot?
Polkadot is a Layer 0 protocol designed to enable interoperability amongst the hetereogenous L1 blockchains that run on top of it. Polkadot provides the security, governance, and cross chain communication to enable seamless interoperability between parachains, or L1 blockchains that serve various specialized use cases. Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain. 

## Meet the Networks (and block explorers)
* **<a href="https://moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbeam</a>** - Mainnet, operating as a parachain on the Polkadot Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonriver.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonriver</a>** - Canary network, or experimental mainnet. Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama Relay Chain
* **<a href="https://moonbase.moonscan.io/" target="_blank">Moonbase Alpha</a>** - The public testnet for Moonbeam and Moonriver. 

## Moonbase Alpha Faucet
* You can get [DEV testnet tokens here](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/faucet/).
* You can make a swap for [testnet cross chain assets here](https://moonbeam-swap.netlify.app/#/swap).
* If you need more tokens in bulk for testing purposes don't hesitate to reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonbeam).

## üé• Introducing Moonbeam's 2022 EthToronto Bounties

### Bounty #1: Build a Cross-Chain DApp using Axelar
The purpose of this bounty is to build a cross chain DApp that uses Axelar‚Äôs General Message Passing. Moonbeam is collaborating with Axelar to advance this vision of Connected Contracts, allowing you to interact with any contract on any chain. Examples of connected contracts include cross-chain governance actions, aggregated liquidity, or simply calling a contract on a remote chain. The bounty can be ‚Äústacked‚Äù with bounties from other teams. A project that includes any cross-chain functionality enabled by Axelar‚Äôs general message passing and has a contract deployed to a Moonbeam network is eligible for this bounty.

#### Rewards:
* 1st place: $2,500
* 2nd place: $1,000

#### Requirements:
* Github Repo - Some code is required. No pitch deck submissions please.
* ReadMe with steps to build app or a link to a public deployment.
* Any smart contracts should be deployed to at least one Moonbeam network (Moonbeam, Moonriver or the Moonbase Alpha testnet).

#### Resources:

* Moonbeam Docs: https://docs.moonbeam.network/
* Getting Started with the Moonbase Alpha Testnet: https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/networks/moonbase/

### Bounty #2: Use a Moonbeam Precompile
Moonbeam‚Äôs precompiles enable you to harness the power of Polkadot via easy-to-use solidity interfaces. These precompiles expose substrate native functionality such as on-chain governance, cross-chain transfers via XCM, staking, and more. They expose these powerful features using the Ethereum API at precompiled contract addresses. Those addresses, as well as tutorials for interacting with them can be found here on the Moonbeam docs site: https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/canonical-contracts/precompiles/

The bounty can be ‚Äústacked‚Äù with bounties from other teams. A project that includes functionality from any Moonbeam precompile and has a contract deployed to a Moonbeam network is eligible for this bounty.

#### Rewards:
* 1st place: $1,000
* 2nd place: $500

#### Requirements:
* Github Repo - Some code is required. No pitch deck submissions please.
* ReadMe with steps to build app or a link to a public deployment.
* Any smart contracts should be deployed to at least one Moonbeam network (Moonbeam, Moonriver or the Moonbase Alpha testnet).

### Judging Criteria
Each submissions will be judged based on 3 categories:

* Technical Complexity - High scoring submissions in this category may demonstrate impressive technical skill and quality of implementation.
* User Experience and Design - Can you abstract away complex cross-chain concepts into a simple and intuitive experience for the end user?
* *For the Cross-Chain Bounty Only*: Cross-Chain Interoperability- Does your application contribute to a cross-chain connected future? The highest scoring submissions in this category will be built with interoperability in mind.
* *For the Precompile Bounty Only*: Creativity and Value Proposition - Are you making something users want? The highest scoring submissions in this category will be creative solutions that fulfill the needs of their users. Copy / paste deployments from other chains will be ranked lower in this category.
